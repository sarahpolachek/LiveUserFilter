This project is from 50 Projects in 50 Days on Udemy.
By Brad Traversy and Florin Pop.

This is project 43, day 42.  

I am stuck and can't seem to get the the content pulling in correctly.  
I think something is wrong with pulling from the API.
I have to take a break and come back to it another time.  

This also happened on day 37 Pokedex.  Has to be with the API, but I haven't been able to figure it out.
